\maketitle
With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), some problems arise. Some people fear that AI could endanger humans as they become more and more powerful. There are also problems involved in ethics issue, for example, a master of Zhejiang University married his robot girlfriend. Though it's a hype, we should take a full account of ethics issue about AI.
\par
I think it's unnecessary to worry about that AI has autonomous power to hurt, destroy or deceive people. Now AI is designed to accomplish a specific task, and supervised by humans. Even if someday AI has more autonomous rights, there must be a restriction mechanism to limit AI.
\par
Last but not least, more things must be done to protect people's data from being misused. Because huge amounts of data are needed to train AI model. And regulators in other field should be aware of the growing use of AI in there industries, then take relevant measures.
