\maketitle
Flight 3U8633, operated by Sichuan Airlines, was en route from Southwest China's Chongqing municipality to Lhasa, capital of Tibet autonomous region. It was forced to divert to Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province \cite{XinhuaNews}, as shown in Fig.~\ref{3U8633}.

According to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), part of the cockpit window broke (Fig.~\ref{brokenwindow})as the Airbus A319 flew over Chengdu. The aircrew enacted emergency code 7700\footnote{an emergency code that represents something emergent happening such as mechanical failure or people's suffering illness.}and landed in Chengdu.

All passengers are safe, although the co-pilot sustained injuries to the face and waist, and another crew member was slight hurt during the emergency landing.

It was their faith of protecting the safety of passengers that made pilots bearing the wild wind and extremely cold. Imagine that the speed of several hundred kilometers per hour and lack of oxygen. We average persons can't sustain any of these.  And when the airplane diverting, the hands and arms of co-pilot was frostbite. What's more his clothes was blown to be worn out (as shown in Fig.~\ref{clothes}). That's entirely a copy of the film \emph{Sully}.

It was touching. As a saying goes, there were not much great time, only someone shouldered bad time. We should be thankful for people who help us.
