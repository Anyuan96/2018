Chinese police have used facial recognition technology to locate and arrest  a man who was among a crowd of 60,000 concert goers. And this is not the  first time Chinese police have used facial recognition systems to catch suspects. 
\par
As we all know, facial recognition is usually used for unlocking phones, payments and clocking in. I think using this technology for fighting crime is a good news for police. It can reduce police's workloads specially in checking monitors for seeking suspects' criminal evidences. 
\par
Using AI technology in resolving these problems  not only improves detection rate, but also increases crime cost. That is to say, it can help maintain social stability and lower crime rate. It's a good thing for building a more harmonious circumstance of society.
