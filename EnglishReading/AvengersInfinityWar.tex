Disney and Marvel's latest superhero movie \emph{Avengers: Infinity War} has pocketed 800 million yuan (US\$ 126 million) at the Chinese box office, as of 4:30pm on Saturday, just two days into its mainland release, according to the Maoyan, a major film database \cite{ShineNews}.
\par
We can see from Fig.~\ref{poster}, there are many Marvel's superheroes such as Iron Man, Captain America, Spider Man. The film tells that as the Avengers and their allies have continued to protect the world from threats too large for any one hero to handle, a new danger has emerged from the cosmic shadows: Thanos. A despot of intergalactic infamy, his goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them to inflict his twisted will on all of reality. Everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment - the fate of Earth and existence itself has never been more uncertain.

\par
As shown in Fig.~\ref{Maoyan}, up to my writing this article, the total box office earnings has reached to 1.1 billion yuan, and the forecasting box office returns is 2.31 billion yuan.  The session of the film is 73.4\% and the gross of it is up to 92.1\%. That's an amazing number. It also shows that marvel has a lot fans in China.
\par
Though, there isn't a good ending. It is still a good film for its special effects and story plots, and its rating in Maoyan also reaches to 8.6 stars from 513k votes. I believe that superheroes will be resurrected in the next film and everything will be fine.
