As we all know, endless queues and long waits at the ticket inspection desks at China major train stations were signature of the Spring Festival travel rush. But this situation seems to be changed this year. With the installment of AI in trains stations this year, including a facial recognition system, the process of passenger identification and waiting was speeded up. In my opinion, it should be widely promoted in every busy station like to relief the pressure of the Spring Festival travel rush.

Facial recognition is only one application of AI, other applications like voice recognition and natural language processing are also gotten rapidly improvment. So I think AI is one of the most promising fields.
